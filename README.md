## üöÄ Introduction

Patchcat is a modern, Postman-like API client that runs entirely in your browser. No installation, no accounts, no cloud sync‚Äîjust a powerful tool to test your APIs with a focus on speed and developer experience. Built with React and TypeScript, it leverages your browser's local storage to persist your work, offering a seamless and private testing environment.

Whether you're debugging a complex GraphQL endpoint, monitoring a WebSocket feed, or simply hitting a REST API, Patchcat provides a clean, intuitive, and feature-rich interface to get the job done.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Protocol Support**: First-class support for **REST**, **GraphQL**, and **WebSockets** in a unified interface.
- **AI-Powered Assistant**: Integrated with Google's Gemini API to automatically analyze responses and suggest relevant test cases for edge cases, validation, and error handling.
- **Advanced GraphQL Client**:
    - Automatic schema introspection.
    - Interactive schema explorer.
    - Autocompletion for queries and variables based on the fetched schema (coming soon!).
- **Real-time WebSocket Client**:

## üöÄ Getting Started

Patchcat is designed to run without any complex build steps.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/patchcat-api-client.git
cd patchcat-api-client
```

**2. Serve the files:**
You can use any simple static file server. Here are a couple of options:

- **Using `npx` (no installation required):**
  ```bash
  npx serve
  ```
- **Using Python:**
  ```bash
  # Python 3
  python -m http.server
  # Python 2
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer
  ```

**3. Open in your browser:**
Navigate to the local URL provided by your server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

To use the AI Assistant features, you need to provide your own Google Gemini API key.

1.  Click the **Settings** icon in the bottom-left corner.
2.  Navigate to the **AI Assistant** section.
3.  Enter your Gemini API key in the input field. The key is stored securely in your browser's local storage and is never sent anywhere except to Google's servers.
4.  Enable the "Enable AI Assistant" toggle.
